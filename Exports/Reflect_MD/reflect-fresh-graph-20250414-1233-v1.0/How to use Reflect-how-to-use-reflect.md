# How to use Reflect

This page will walk you through the basics of how to use reflect effectively. If you'd prefer, you can also watch our [onboarding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYhInYej-lg).

First, let's make sure you've set up Reflect properly.

We recommend:
1. syncing [your calendar](https://reflect.app/preferences/credentials),
2. installing our [Chrome](https://reflect.app/chrome-extension), and [Safari](https://reflect.app/safari-extension) browser extensions to save links and highlights
3. Download our [iOS and desktop apps](https://reflect.app/download).

### üìù The Daily Notes

The first thing you'll notice when you open up Reflect are the **daily notes** stretching forwards and backwards through infinity. Your memory works through time and space so we've mirrored that inside the product.

By default, everything should go inside today's daily note. Your journal, your meeting notes, your bookmarks... all of it.

Start with a fresh day and type `/journal` and then hit `return`. You'll see the following:

![journal](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2Fb8a81a353c20402d88517d0c5417b507?alt=media\&token=967f7807-bf0b-43c3-ba9c-7ed3e119c59a)

This is a default template we've created for you (you can edit it under the apps preferences).

Notice you can use both bullets or plain text for your notes, but we recommend the former (especially for your daily notes). You can collapse a bullet list by clicking on the parent bullet. This helps keep your daily note nice and clean.

You can watch our walkthrough of how to use the daily notes format [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlg5__dRUZg).

Now let's create a backlink.

### üîó Organizing your notes

In Reflect there is no hierarchy, only association. We've designed it like this because it more accurately represents the way memory works.

A backlink is link between two of your notes. Think of it like a link on the web, but between concepts in your notes.

In Reflect you create a backlink by typing [(two left brackets). You should backlink any entity you write in your notes (like a person)](https://reflect.site/g/welcomenote/6a7cfff5979c4ece8c13d2eda56335a3).

For example:

![backlinks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2F53c7507ca78c4f9eb4f06314725ca557?alt=media\&token=cfd8dd4c-33fd-44fa-a0dc-75e046a004dc)

These backlinks automatically start organizing your notes. We delve further into this in [[The power of Backlinks]].

### üé§ Transcribing audio notes

Reflect has a voice transcriber built in to both it's desktop and mobile apps. It uses AI to transcribe your voice with near perfect accuracy. It's likely to completely change how you take notes!

You can record a voice note using the microphone in the top left of the desktop app, and on mobile by tapping the `+` icon and then the microphone.

Audio notes will be placed in your Daily Note. It's quite useful to use the AI palette editor to organize your transcribed voice notes.

### ‚ú® AI Palette Editor

You can pull up Reflect's AI assistant using `cmd j`.

There is a collection of pre-built prompts you can use. The prompt will be applied to any text that is highlighted when you pull it up.

The AI palette editor can help you format your notes, fix your writing, help you take meeting notes and a lot more. You can also write and save your own custom prompts!

![ai palette](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2F570a96b18e074abf90330dbb94a9878a?alt=media\&token=a88d3797-3e2c-4a90-af6c-7968cd90291c)

### üîé Advanced search

Press `cmd k` or (`control k` if you're on windows) and you'll see our advanced search. Whenever you've forgotten something, this is the place to come to find it. You can add filters to narrow down your search, search semantically for words or phrases you don't remember, and even chat with your notes using AI!

We also support some basic commands in here like: `go to daily note`, `5 days from now`, and `Go to a random note`.

![advanced search](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2F4a2a6952f8a44262b0117f98512648d2?alt=media\&token=02964032-5910-43fe-892d-049f7b75ba0f)

### ‚úÖ Tasks

You can add tasks to any note, and they will be collected in the Tasks tab on the left.

Tasks are shown as a circle you can check off. Regular square checkboxes are not added to the Tasks tab. Add a task by typing `+` and a space on a new line. You can also convert bullets and checkboxes to tasks using `cmd + shift + return`

![tasks](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2Fd6f5b910c4264643bf1e612e52a1168b?alt=media\&token=2ea4c1e7-7bdc-4f0a-ac78-e087415778b6)

### üï£ Note history

We save every key-stroke so you can always go forwards and backwards in time. You can find a note's history by clicking the "Show History" button under _note actions_ on the right-hand _sidebar_.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard-shortcuts

You can always see all the keyboard shortcuts by pressing `cmd /` (or control if you're on windows). So if there's only one shortcut you remember, it's that one.

Here are the shortcuts you're most likely to use on a day-by-day basis:
- Backlink: `[[`
- Bullet list: `- space`
- Todo list: `cmd return` (from inside of a bullet-list)
- New note: `cmd n`
- Search notes: `cmd k`
- Go to daily note: `cmd d`
- Pull up AI editor `cmd j`
