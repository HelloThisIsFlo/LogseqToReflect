- Today I started using [[Reflect]]
- How should I use [[Reflect]]?
  - Record everything that happens in your day from your daily note (in a list just like this!)
    - Write to do lists and items, a running log of what happens in your day, people you meet, ideas, daily reflections, etc.
    - You can watch workflow videos showing how to use Reflect on our [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@reflect-notes).
    - We've created a note for you on [[How to use Reflect]] in case you need to reference it at any time.
  - Use AI to organize your notes
    - Pull up the AI palette editor using **cmd J**
    - Chat with your notes with AI through our advanced search (**cmd K**)
  - If you're not yet familiar, learn about [how to use backlinks](https://reflect.academy/linking-your-notes)
