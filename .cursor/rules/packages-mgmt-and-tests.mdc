- When writing tests always write them in `pytest` style, never `unittest` style
- All packages are installed via `uv`, not `pip` or anything else.
- In most cases you don't need to install any package, it's already taken care of
- You need to use the `uv` command to run things, for instance:
  - Run tests: `uv run pytest`
  - Run a script: `uv run python -m ....`
- If you _do_ need to install a new package, use: `uv add <package_name>`, never use `pip ..` and never use `uv run pip ...`
