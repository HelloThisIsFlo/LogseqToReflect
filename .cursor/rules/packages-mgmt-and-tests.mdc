# Package management
- All packages are installed via `uv`, not `pip` or anything else.
- In most cases you don't need to install any package, it's already taken care of
- You need to use the `uv` command to run things, for instance:
  - Run tests: `uv run pytest`
  - Run a script: `uv run python -m ....`
- If you _do_ need to install a new package, use: `uv add <package_name>`, never use `pip ..` and never use `uv run pip ...`

# Tests
- Write tests for each new feature
- The tests are under the `tests` directory
- When writing tests always write them in `pytest` style, never `unittest` style
- Always run all unit-tests at once (with `uv run pytest`) instead of individual ones. This helps you identify breaking changes early

# Manual Checking
- If you want to check the output of your changes, simply run the tests and compare:
  - `tests/full_test_workspace`
  - `full_test_workspace (Reflect format)`
- If you need to experiment with extra tricky cases, feel free to edit or add files in `tests/full_test_workspace`

# Project
- This is a LogSeq to Reflect converter (LogSeq and Reflect are both note-taking apps)
- It converts LogSeq files into a format that's easy to import in Reflect
